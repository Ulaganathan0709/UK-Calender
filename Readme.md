## API Reference

Data is retrieved from the UK government's bank holidays API:
`https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json`

## Asynchronous Data Retrieval

The application uses the `fetch` API to retrieve data from the server asynchronously. Promises are utilized to handle the asynchronous nature of HTTP requests, allowing the application to continue running while waiting for the data. Upon successful retrieval, the data is then rendered on the page.
